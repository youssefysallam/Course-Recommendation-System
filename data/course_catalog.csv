Participants explore how institutions and their leaders responded to these challenges, sometimes creating accommodations or changes in traditional settings, and other times prompting new structures that often marginalized the newcomers.

How has the reach of Empire been historically constructed, critiqued in fiction, and/or sustained through narrative: What forms of identity are available to individuals who have been displaced, either through personal choice or random (and often tragic) circumstance? And, finally, how ''post'' is postcolonialism? To answer these and related questions, this course will further explore the different experiences of colonization, decolonization, and postcolonial culture and politics during the twentieth century in South Africa, Nigeria, Jamaica, India, Australia, and Northern Ireland. Taking a transdisciplinary approach, we will conduct inquiries into the nature of sociopolitical and cultural conditions that characterize current or former colonies, the diverse registers in which these conditions are discursively articulated, and the modes, spaces, and politics of their (re)production, circulation, and consumption. Some themes this course will address include the psychology of colonization and settlement; violence and decolonization; constructions of the ''Other'' by imperial center; hybrid cultural formations wrought by the impacts between colonizer and colonized.

Biomimicry asks the question: What would nature do? How can we learn from nature, not just about nature? The goal is to create resilient products, processes, and policies by learning from and ''listening to'' nature, to wisdom held in species and ecological systems that has been evolving and accumulating over the past 3.8 billion years. Biomimicry is neither aesthetic nor technological, or just a form. Rather, it focuses on sustainable adaptability, adaptive growth and resiliency. Natural systems and organisms provide stunning examples of effective adaptation, communication, collaboration, resource production and storage, and energy-efficient designs that support multifunctioning processes. Animals, plants and microbes are consummate engineers; they have found what works, what is appropriate, and most importantly, what is resilient for all not just for each of them. For example, biomimicry helps create a solar cell that is inspired by a tree and its leaf with chloroplast and chlorophyll, a passive cooling system for buildings inspired by a termite mound; many species can accumulate, store and share water from air, or developed new strategies for restoring degraded ecosystems. People are nature, and human cultures with long term residency in particular ecosystems hold crucial (traditional) knowledge for living sustainably in each context."|" "|"Natural Sciences"|""|""

This course focuses on social inclusion and social development in a global context. The term ''social inclusion'' has been conceptualized as a process, a state of being included, and a method for integrating those excluded or at risk of being excluded due to disability or other reasons and conditions into society. In development studies, the term ''social development'' captures the idea of improving people's well-being and quality of life, and is often defined in reference to particular social problems. Globalization is the process of interaction and integration among economies, societies, and cultures across the globe through forces such as international trade and transport and advances in communication technology. Students will examine definitions, current and historical perspectives on and approaches to these concepts, and their implications for policy and practice.

The course employs an expansive epistemological approach to focus on the theme of justice in its many facets, including racial, gender, social, economic, climate/environmental, global, spatial, criminal/retributive, restorative/reparative, distributive, poetic, natural, and divine. The course integrates a global transdisciplinary framework with the explicit and pronounced de-centering of Euro-American knowledge in favour of amplifying voices and experiences from Majority World contexts. It therefore centers specifically (if not exclusively) on Global South and Black, Indigenous and People of Color's critiques of the global political economy from the standpoints of those at the ''margins''. With that, it engages students in a detailed confrontation of the sometimes searing Global South critiques of 'development' as an imperialist and racist idea alongside highlighting critical, postcolonial, and/or radical theoretical concepts such as racial capitalism, alternate conceptions of gender, pluriversality (as contrasted with the binary of universality versus cultural relativism), third world approaches to international law, calls for decoloniality and antiracism, and more. Through the course, students will focus on innovative ways of thinking about and doing justice, inclusion, and development work as an intersectional 'insider' to the economically, socially, or politically excluded community of affinity or choice. The course therefore draws stark contrast with most scholarship on 'culture' and social justice 'innovation' that concerns itself with preparing outsiders to go into marginal 'other' communities to do socially transformative work."|" "|" "|""|""

Profit-seeking corporations transform economic resources into outputs via organizations; governmental agencies delivered services and regulate other organizations; and numerous non-governmental organizations, from unions to churches to advocacy groups, constitute the realm of civil society. Organizations shape how a society functions. They are the vehicles through which societal-level interests and agendas are channeled. They represent a form a structural power; some groups systematically benefit relative to others as a result of how organizations operate. Organizations are frequently the target of public policy, as they are sites of both societal aspirations (productivity, innovation, opportunities for advancement) and societal challenges (inequality, discrimination, pollution, deception). Organizations can also be arenas of resistance and change, advancing new ideas and addressing old problems. An understanding of organizations - their sources of power, their role in governance, and their structures and processes - is therefore highly relevant for future researchers who wish to conduct studies of use for policy analysts, activists, and managers in the private, public, and non-profit sectors."|" "|" "|""|""

New technologies, climate change, economic crises as well as contemporary iterations of terrorism and warfare have all intensified the global movements of people, goods, ideas, cultures, and money. This has reinvigorated the study of migration in earlier periods, with many arguing that related phenomena have been endemic to the human population since our beginning. New frameworks that emphasize networks and relationality, and bring into the foreground interculturalism, borders and borderlands, and hybridic formations have begun to reorder ways of reading human cultures and civilizations. The course brings together theoretical frameworks and methodological approaches from both the humanities and social sciences (e.g. anthropology, literary studies, performance studies, psychology, ethnomusicology, sociolinguistics, history, and sociology) with various forms of cultural expression (e.g., poetry, film, music, literature). The course places the different theories/strategies in dialogue to empower students of transdisciplinarity with tools for shaping their own unique studies of migration and diaspora in ways that exceed the boundaries of particular disciplines. Themes explored will include: the contexts for the newly invigorated field; the multiple meanings and models of diaspora and migration; the relation of migration and diaspora to conquest, colonialism, post colonialism, refugeeism, political exile, etc.; the heterogeneity of diasporic groups; the problems and potentials of assimilation, acculturation and transculturation; nativism and the hostility of hostlands; generational conflicts and continuities in the (re)production of culture; the role of language and other cultural practices in migratory experiences; the significance of memory for the production of what Salman Rushdie calls ''imaginary homelands''; and t"|" "|" "|""|""

Communities are not static: They come into being, evolve and may dissolve. Living in Liquid Times (Bauman 2007) the certainty of modernity ''evaporates'' and uncertainty permeates our daily lives destabilizing our sense of ''belonging.'' Community has also become a principal arena of organized collective action to change or preserve the status quo. Communities are thus complex, dynamic, contested, and contradictory.	This course explores these issues in theory and practice, from the academic literature to its use society at large. The idea of community is contested: its definition is not clear lacking a consistent body of knowledge with theories about its origins, functions, and use in contemporary society.

The third centers on theoretical reflections on cities as the fundamental development theaters, e.g., the spatial formations for the production of all social, economic, political cultural and technological arenas of societies (with a particular focus on four US cities: New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and Miami).

The Urban Planning and Community Development Program aims to develop urban planners with a clear social justice and equitability vision. The practicing urban planner faces an array of challenges in the globalizing world. Among these, access to rights previously taken for granted that may be limited under neoliberal regimes.

The best proposal writers are strong communicators who provide ''big picture'' context and important details in a clear and straightforward manner. In addition, effective proposal writers keep their audience's interests in mind by following application guidelines and conveying the ''fit'' between a proposal and a given funder's priorities. A good budget reflects the proposal narrative by describing the realistic anticipated costs associated with a given scope of work.In this intensive, noncredit course, you will review basic concepts about proposals and budgets and then hone your proposal and budget development skills through at-home assignments, in-class exercises, and oral presentations. The aim is to enable you to master ''best practice'' approaches to preparing proposals and budgets. Primary attention is given to seeking grants from foundation donors; however, a brief introduction to government grants is also covered.The course helps advanced beginners and intermediate-level proposal writers refine their craft. To gain the most from the course, bring a specific project idea that needs funding and a potential prospect for it. If you need help identifying a project and/or a prospect or wish to work with others on a small group project, you must request permission to enroll from the instructor.Prerequisite: Successful completion of the course, Successful Grant Writing from A to Z or permission of the instructor.Upon successful completion of this course: you will receive 17.5 educational contact hours (1.75 Continuing Education Units, or CEUs).

Some public health measures are quite intrusive. For example, seatbelt laws or restrictions on the sale of large scale sodas. Some think that these measures are unjustified because it should be up to the individual to choose how to lead his or her life. By examining the initiatives and laws designed to reduce tobacco use, we will examine how a government's obligation to respect individual freedom should be weighed against an obligation to prevent disease and improve population health. Other public health measures seem woefully inadequate given the inequalities that affect disadvantaged groups in society. For example, risk factors for obesity are not simply linked to personal choice, but to food security and access to healthy foods. By examining the data on health disparities and social determinants of health, we will explore how far a government's obligations should extend to narrow inequalities that put certain groups at increased risk of disease and poor health outcomes."|" "|" "|""|""

We will discuss the fundamental basic assumptions of natural science, including: the world is knowable, humans can perceive and understand the world through structured observation, the things that happen in the world around us have natural causes, experiments and observations can be used to learn about these natural causes, and the causes that operate in the natural world are consistent and therefore can be represented through models and other forms of mathematical or quantitative expression.

The Family unit was an operative ideological concept for very different kinds of revolutions, from the politics of liberation to the feminist revolution in education and social practices. Orienting this affair will be what we can call ''the First Family'' of revolutionary thought, which is not that of the French king and his famous queen Marie Antoinette, nor that of the mad George III and his politically rebellious son, later George IV, but that of the Godwin-Shelley Circle. The primary members of this circle are William Godwin, Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Shelley and Percy Bysshe Shelley (who came to study at Godwin's feet and instead eloped with his daughter). Behind his family romance of ''free love,'' revolution, and theories of education lie the political thought of highly influential figures such as Rousseau, and the feminist politics of care, a contribution to the enduring problem of ethical action (best articulated for the Romantics by Spinoza). Both revolution and care as ethical action struggle against the increasingly dominant ideology of the aesthetic for this family that combines and traverses the standard period division into ''first generation'' and ''second generation'' Romantics.

This emphasis is facilitated by the subject matter; by examining issues of controversy and conflict surrounding the work-society relationship, the course leads students to develop their critical skills in order to understand fully those issues. (Note: In discussions of race, gender, and class, it is necessary to recognize that there are many differences within these groups as well as between them.

We will read (in English translations) from the famous Icelandic Sagas of Vikings as well as from poetry that memorializes warrior-kings and tells of dragon slayings. But we will also consider writings about the Vikings from cultures that fell victim to their raids and invasions, including the great Old English poem Beowulf. We will thus be able to critically compare contemporary uses and portrayals of the Vikings with the medieval sources, and will even trace some of the sources for the narratives of Tolkien's famous Lord of the Rings. Our study of Viking Literatures will be also rooted in their various historical contexts, which will give us a more complex understanding of a society and its very rich literary and artistic traditions than many popular portrayals. These literatures will offer us fascinating insights into the society of the Vikings and their Anglo-Saxon victims, including elements of religion, gender and sexuality, economy, technologies of violence, and government.

These global markets raise important questions about what it means for human dignity when body parts and services are treated as commercially available. Do these transactions commodify women (particularly those from the Global South) by treating them as disposable, fragmentary bodies for the benefit of wealthy customers? Or do they offer new pathways out of poverty, by enabling women to assert control over this productive resource? Using a transnational feminist and human rights lens, this course examines these issues, with a particular focus on sex tourism/trafficking and gestational surrogacy. The course also looks at a very different type of cross-border travel - namely, the flight of persons in conflict zones for the purpose of escaping political violence rather than to seek or sell an intimate service.

Aquaculture is currently the fastest growing segment of the food industry, with more then half of what we eat from the ocean coming from aquaculture. This is an increasingly competitive space that suffers from a tradition of malpractice and misunderstanding as well as a regulatory culture that lags far behind an innovative rate. Site selection, gear, seed and feed procurement, marketing, and supply chain dynamics are all important elements of a successful aquaculture operation that demand an understanding of regulatory, financial, and marketing and entrepreneurial principles. This course is designed to introduce students to these challenges and equip them with the tools needed to engage within the industry on a sophisticated, successful level. Students will gain a foundational understanding of how to move from ''I would like to operate an aquaculture business'' to ''I am operating an aquaculture business''. Building on this understanding, students will prepare their own business plans to demonstrate mastery of key aspects of operational efficiency necessary support the vital financial structure of any business. Lastly, through the concepts of entrepreneurship, students will learn how to integrate business concepts to be able to develop and sustain a successful aquaculture business. This course will be organized into three parts: Essentials for a business in aquaculture, operating a business in aquaculture, and moving from concept to execution.

In this course, we will chart the development of science fiction as a distinct popular cultural form, paying particular attention to its defining characteristics. As such, we'll study a wide range of themes and issues central to science fiction literature: early narratives that champion a scientific sense of wonder and possibility alongside others that articulate fears of technological destruction; the development of the ''first-contact'' narrative that imagines meetings between humans and aliens both positively and negatively; the alternating hopes and fears that characterize utopias and dystopias; the dreams of an elsewhere captured in intergalactic space operas; imaginative conceptions of temporality in time travel and alternative history narratives; and the development of cyberpunk and its focus on the integration of humans with cybernetic technology and the development of artificial intelligence. Alongside the exploration of science fiction as a recognizable set of familiar narratives, we'll also study how these narratives relate to their own historical and cultural moments, expressing particular hopes and fears, anxieties and desires.

They engage the free-play of the political imagination as a form of wish-fulfillment and social daydreaming in order to extrapolate better worlds from the less than perfect present worlds of specific societies. As the negative reflection of utopian desire, dystopias similarly interrogate their societies, magnifying and exacerbating troubling political and social injustices. In this course, we will first trace the development of utopian/dystopian thought and its historical origins in literature and philosophy. From here, we will examine contemporary manifestations of utopia/dystopia in diverse societies in a variety of different mediums (including film, music, graphic novels and literature, as well as religious writings, legal and political documents, and philosophical works). We'll focus on interpreting these utopian and dystopian texts as particular instantiations of cultural work in different societies in response to specific historical and political conditions. In keeping with this cross-cultural approach, the course will engage with a range of modern utopian/dystopian texts from at least four broad perspectives: African, American, European, and Afrofuturist-diasporic. These perspectives will allow us to analyze how utopian and dystopian works are always positioned at the border between defining a particular culture at a particular moment in time (how the writers of the text perceive their culture, its faults, its possibilities) and cultural change (the utopia or dystopia that this culture may transform or harden into given these traits). That is, despite a pretense towards universalism, utopias and dystopias are always about particular wish fulfillments rooted in localized, existing socio-cultural-political conditions. They are always raced, classed, and gendered, revealing issues of cultural conflict within their given local cultural determinations.

In this course we begin by describing the origin of the concept of entropy in thermodynamics. We then discuss how the microscopic theory of atoms led to statistical mechanics, which makes it possible to derive and extend thermodynamics. This leads to the definition of entropy in terms of probabilities on the set of accessible microscopic states of a system and provided the inspiration for modern information theory starting with the seminal work of Shannon. We then discuss a variety of fundamental issues that emerge in defining information and how one must exercise care in discussing concepts such as order, disorder, and incomplete knowledge.

We will focus on gendered themes such as private vs. public, sameness vs. difference, sexuality, feminism, and women's political roles, and we will look at major moments like the Enlightenment, French Revolution, Imperialism, the World Wars, Eastern Europe, Decolonization and Contemporary Identity. At the same time, we will take an intersectional lens to many of the events of European history, using gender alongside of class (in the Industrial Revolution and the Russian Revolution), race (in imperialism and decolonization), ethnicity (especially in discussions of ethnic cleansing in the Balkans), and sexuality (in the interwar period and in the contemporary period). In so doing, we will demonstrate how a focus on women and gender, with implications in class, ethnicity, race, and sexuality, leads to an essential shift in how we think about the major times and events of European history.

It focuses on the relationship among knowledge, power and representation, and their constitutive role in shaping epistemology: 'the theory of knowledge,' or 'how we know what we know,' and ontology: 'our assumptions about the form and nature of reality.' The aim of the course is to develop an awareness of how knowledge is constructed, critically examined, evaluated, and transformed, by communities and individuals. The course introduces students to theory as it emerges from particular knowledge claims. It reviews the construction of concepts, the use of concepts in social inquiry, and the inherent challenges of representation, and focuses on the key decision point of formulating a research question as it emerges from theory and articulates concepts, or a conceptual framework. It also introduces students to a range of epistemologies in the interdisciplinary social sciences that explicitly address issues of positionality, reflexivity, power, the lived experience of those we study, and critical consciousness. These epistemologies include critical theory, decolonial studies, postcolonial studies, feminist perspectives, critical race theory, indigenous theory, queer theory, institutional politics, disability theory and others. Discussions address the many ways in which power influences the research process at every step. Further, this course emphasizes a public scholarship approach to research in contemporary times, which produces knowledge that is available outside of the academy, useful to relevant stakeholders, and vital to the democratization of research. The themes of global inclusion and social development permeate all key concepts of the course."|" "|" "|""|""

Particular emphasis is placed on the concepts of cultural diversity and power, and their implications for design and method choices as well as stakeholder participation in research and evaluation. 'Cultural diversity' refers to differences among (groups of) individuals with respect to ethnicity, race, age, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability/health, socio-economic status, and other dimensions.

While psychology historically has focused on experimental and quasiexperimental approaches to learning, increasingly psychologists are viewing these as only one approach to learning and embracing a wider variety approaches to building knowledge about people's lives and the societies within which they live. The course is designed to introduce students to some of these alternate ways of conducting research that are based on analyzing interviews and text. These methods are especially helpful in studying human experiences and actions (e.g., emotion, dialogue, psychotherapy), and in studying experiences of minorities and marginalized people. The course culminates in students' development of their own research proposals. The following are the course objectives: (1) To understand some of the historical and philosophical foundations for qualitative methods; (2) to become acquainted with a range of qualitative methods that are used in psychology; (3) to learn how to collect and analyze data; (4) to learn how to write a research proposal using APA format and understand how results are presented; and (5) to learn to evaluate qualitative research studies. They help to develop the skills of how to ask questions and seek out information that will guide you - skills that can transfer into many settings. Students have used their proposals as the basis for an honors thesis, as a proposal for research in their workplace, to apply for grants, and as writing samples for graduate studies. It is especially helpful for students who wish to complete a thesis or apply to graduate programs in the social sciences. These skills build from one class to the next so students need to commit to attending this class regularly."|"Pre-requisite: PSYCH 100 or 101 and PSYCH 201 and PSYCH 210 or 215 or 230 and Minimum of 60 credit hours"|" "|""|""

Through formalist, narrative, and sociohistorical analysis, students will achieve a better understanding of how European art shaped Disney, and how that art has engaged (or failed to engage) with societal change.Assignments are built around Disney's feature films, to be supplemented by the premodern texts and visual arts that inspired them, as well as relevant critical studies.

In addition to individual/internal strategies like meditation and direct bilateral strategies like negotiation, many of the approaches in the conflict resolution field involve skilled third parties assisting those in conflict. This class surveys a range of third-party interventions, from arbitration and ombuds work to mediation, dialogue, and circle processes, among others. It explores the underlying logic and theories of change beneath the various third-party interventions as well as foundational questions of neutrality and positionality, and develops cross-cutting skills like conflict analysis, effective communication, and evaluation. It introduces how various interventions work in practice, and offers opportunities to explore cases, hear directly from practitioners, and practice through applied exercises in order to expose students to the strengths and drawbacks of different interventions for various contexts and types of conflict."|" "|" "|""|""
